    "# Reproducing ECCO Version 4 Release 5 (Forward Simulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "ECCO Version 4 Release 5 (V4r5) is ECCO's next central estimate after V4r4. Reproducing ECCO V4r5 is essentially the same as reproducing ECCO V4r4, as described in [Reproducing ECCO Version 4 Release 4](./reproducing_v4r4.ipynb). Like ECCO V4r4, ECCO V4r5 is a **forward** simulation with optimized controls that have been adjusted through an iterative adjoint-based optimization process to minimize the model–data misfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to V4r4, ECCO V4r5 extends the model integration period from 1992–2017 to 1992–2019. It also includes ice sheets around Antarctica. Meltwater from these ice sheets is an important component of both regional and global sea level change. Including this melt introduces an important physical process that was missing in V4r4.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we provide instructions on how to reproduce the ECCO V4r5 estimate on the P-Cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Log in to P-Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Users first connect to the P-Cluster and change the directory to the user's directory on /efs_ecco, as described in the [P-Cluster introduction tutorial](../../preliminary/pcluster-login.ipynb):\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh -i /path/to/privatekey -X USERNAME@34.210.1.198\n",
    "```\n",
    "The directory `/efs_ecco/USERNAME/` (replace `USERNAME` with the user's actual username) is where the run should be conducted. Users can change to that directory with the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /efs_ecco/USERNAME/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modules \n",
    "Modules on Linux allow users to easily configure their environment for specific software, such as compilers (e.g., GCC, Intel) and MPI libraries (e.g., OpenMPI, MPICH). Users can switch between versions without manually setting environment variables. Running ECCO on different machines and platforms often involves a different set of modules tailored to the system’s architecture and operating system. The modules used in the P-Cluster are loaded in the [example .bashrc](example.bashrc), which should have been downloaded and renamed to `/home/USERNAME/.bashrc` as described in the [P-Cluster introduction tutorial](../../preliminary/pcluster-login.ipynb), so that the required modules are loaded automatically. Specificity, the modules loaded in [example .bashrc](example.bashrc) are as follows:\n",

    "## Code, Namelists, and Input Files\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of time, the MITgcm and V4r5 specific code have been downloaded to the P-Cluster in /efs_ecco/ECCO/V4/r5/, using the following command (be sure to replace `USERNAME` with the user's actual username):\n",
    "```\n",
    "rsync -av /efs_ecco/ECCO/V4/r5/WORKINGDIR /efs_ecco/USERNAME/r5/\n",
    "```\n",
    "Everyone has a directory at `/efs_ecco/USERNAME/`. There is no need to manually create the subdirectory `/efs_ecco/USERNAME/r5/`; the `rsync` command above will create it automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input files—such as atmospheric forcing and initial conditions, are several hundreds gigabytes in size. These input files have also been downloaded and stored on the P-Cluster in `/efs_ecco/ECCO/V4/r5/input/`. Do not copy them to the user's own directory. Instead, create a symbolic link in the user's own directory pointing to the input file directory using the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /efs_ecco/USERNAME/r5/\n",
    "ln -s /efs_ecco/ECCO/V4/r5/input .\n",
    "```\n",
    "The symbolic link will be used to access the input files in the example run script described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The directory structure under `/efs_ecco/USERNAME/r5/` now looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Compile\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for compiling the code are as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "cd ..\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `optfile` `linux_ifort_impi_aws_sysmodule` has been specifically customized for the P-Cluster. If successful, the executable `mitgcmuv` will be generated in the `build` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully compiling the code and generating the executable in the `build` directory (`WORKINGDIR/ECCOV4/release5/build/mitgcmuv`), you can proceed with running the model. For this purpose, we provide an [example V4r5 run script](run_script_slurm_v4r5.bash) that integrates the model over a three-month period. (See below for instructions on how to modify the [run script](run_script_slurm_v4r5.bash) to run the full integration period from 1992 to 2019.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The script is also available on the P-Cluster at `/efs_ecco/ECCO/V4/r5/scripts/run_script_slurm_v4r5.bash`. Copy it to your working directory at `/efs_ecco/USERNAME/r5/WORKINGDIR/ECCOV4/release5` (replace `USERNAME` with your actual username, but keep the directory structure the same). Then submit the script using `sbatch` with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /efs_ecco/USERNAME/r5/WORKINGDIR/ECCOV4/release5\n",

    "Once submitting the job, SLURM will generate a job id and show the following message:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Submitted batch job 194\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can then check the status the job by using the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "squeue\n",
    "```\n",
    "Usually, SLURM takes several minutes to configure a job, with the status (`ST`) showing `CF` (for configuring): \n",
    "```\n",
    "             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER  ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\n",

    "```\n",
    "After a while, squeue will show the status changing to `R` (for run) as shown in following:\n",

    "```\n",
    "The run directory is `/efs_ecco/USERNAME/ECCO/V4/r5/WORKINGDIR/ECCOV4/release5/run/`. The 3-month integration takes about 45 minutes to complete. `NORMAL END` inside the batch log file `/efs_ecco/USERNAME/ECCO/V4/r5/WORKINGDIR/ECCOV4/release5/ECCOv4r5-194-out` (replace `194` with the actual job ID) indicates a successfully completed run. Another way to check if the run ended normally is to examine the last line of the file `STDOUT.0000` in the run directory. If that line is `PROGRAM MAIN: Execution ended Normally`, then the run completed successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "The run will output monthly means and snapshots of diagnostic fields in the subdirectory `diags/` of the run directory. These fields can be analyzed using Jupyter Notebooks presented in some of the ECCO Summer School tutorials.\n",
