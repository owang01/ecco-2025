    "# Configure TAF on the P-Cluster\n",
    "Transformation of Algorithms in Fortran (TAF) is a commercial software package developed by [FastOpt](http://fastopt.com/) that performs source-to-source translation of Fortran code. ECCO uses TAF to generate adjoint code, which is essential for producing ocean and sea-ice state estimates, conducting adjoint-based reconstructions and decompositions, and supporting many other applications. Thanks to the generous support of FastOpt, attendees of the ECCO Summer School are granted access to TAF for generating adjoint code on the P-Cluster during the summer school. This tutorial describes the steps to set up the environment for using TAF on the P-Cluster.\n",

    "## TAF Helper Script: staf\n",
    "Users send Fortran code to the TAF server. After processiing (i.e., translation), the TAF server reutrns the translated Fortran code, such as adjoint code. A script developed by FastOpt, called `staf`, faciliates the use of TAF, including setting up the environment, handling communication between the user's machine (the P-Cluster in our case) and the TAF server, and enabling a wide range of TAF-related operations through command-line options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users should go to their home directory, create a directory called `bin`, and then copy `staf` to it, as described by the following commands: \n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ~\n",
    "mkdir bin\n",
    "cd bin\n",
    "cp -p /efs_ecco/ECCO/TAF/staf .\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "If you are using a different shell, add the path to your shell's configuration file in a similar way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Issue the following command **outside** the `bin` directory to check whether the path has been added correctly:\n",

Secure Shell (SSH) keys—a pair of cryptographic keys used for secure authentication in the SSH protocol—are used to interact with the TAF server. For the ECCO Summer School, a common pair of SSH keys is provided for all TAF users; this key pair has been authorized by FastOpt for use with TAF. Please place the SSH keys in the `.ssh` subdirectory of your home directory, and restrict the read permissions to yourself.\n",
